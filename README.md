## About This Plugin

This is a modified version of the official Mylio plugin for Lightroom. It introduces functionality to handle virtual copies in Lightroom in a way that integrates smoothly with Mylio. Here's what it does:

1. For each virtual copy in Lightroom, a new JPEG file is created with a name like `FILE_Copy 1.jpeg`, `FILE_Copy 2.jpeg`, and so on.
2. These files are shown next to the original photo in Mylio for easy access.
3. The edits for each virtual copy are saved as a **snapshot** in the XMP file, ensuring that no edits are lost.

## Installation & Usage

1. Download the plugin from this repository.
2. Follow Lightroomâ€™s instructions for installing plugins.
3. Use the plugin to process your virtual copies as described above.
